# Notes-app
This is a simple notes app I made for practice with HTML/CSS/JS. Currently, notes are stored on the browser's storage, but it is made in a way that would make switching it over to storing the notes on a server trivial.

## Features
- Markdown support for notes, courtesy of [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
- Searching of notes by title. Search results update as you type.
- Favourite notes to have them appear first
- Fully responsive
